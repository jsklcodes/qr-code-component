### What I learned

I created this project with the goal of reviewing HTML and CSS. Despite its simplicity, the main lesson was about organization. From the start, I focused on structuring my code to be clear, readable, and semantic, both in HTML and CSS. Additionally, I paid special attention to maintaining a consistent and coherent versioning throughout development.
